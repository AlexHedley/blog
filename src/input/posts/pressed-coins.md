Adding to my collection addiction I made a site to track the pressed coins I've bought or been gifted over the years.

I need to look into a way to display these.... maybe get them all framed. I've been holding off as I'll likely buy more but I could just get a second set framed later. Would be nice to have them up on the wall instead of hidden away in a box.
