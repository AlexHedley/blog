Why make just a list when you can make a list of lists! Here are some of the board games I play...

- https://alexhedley.com/games/
  - https://github.com/AlexHedley/games

You can find me on [BoardGameArena](https://boardgamearena.com/) ([AlexHedley](https://boardgamearena.com/player?id=91017710)). I've been a premium member for a number of years and working on building my own game with [@corofides](https://github.com/corofides/), I'll post about that more when I've actually made something.

I could have just registered the scores on [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) [@AlexHedley](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/AlexHedley) but then I don't get to make another site / list!
