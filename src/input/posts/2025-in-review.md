<!-- # 2025 in review -->

Last year I wrote my [2024 In Review](2024-in-review), it's time for **2025**!

_Professional Achievements_

Completed the **Java Foundations Professional Certificate by JetBrains** [JetBrains and LinkedIn Partner to Launch a Professional Certificate](https://blog.jetbrains.com/team/2025/01/29/jetbrains-and-linkedin-partner-to-launch-a-professional-certificate/)

Also recertified my [AWS Cloud Practitioner](https://alexhedley.com/blog/posts/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner), that came round quickly.

Planning on [GitHub Actions Certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/github-actions/?practice-assessment-type=certification) later this year.

_Personal Achievements_

I did some more workshops this year including [Copper Rose Workshop](copper-rose-workshop) and managed to go on a number of holidays, adding more stamps to my passport :). The idea is to spend money on experiences instead of "things", but I can't stop myself with the clutter :p. See [Lego](https://alexhedley.com/lego/) and [Funko Pop](https://alexhedley.com/funkopop/). A few more [Escape Rooms](https://alexhedley.com/escaperooms/) completed. Lots more [Gigs](https://alexhedley.com/Gigs/) attended, plus added some charts to show off the data a little.

Lots of great movies this year from my [FilmsBlog](https://alexhedley.com/FilmsBlog/). Thoroughly enjoyed _The Ballad of Wallis Island_ which I managed to get the vinyl soundtrack for :).

I ported [nocco](dotnet-nocco) to .NET 9 and built [.NET by Example](dotnet-by-example) using it. Just need to start adding some content.

I worked on adding some external community widgets to [Blashing](the-beginning-of-blashing). Bits and pieces with [Utility Blazor](utility-blazor) and started a KMP version - [Utility Kotlin](https://github.com/Alex-Hedley/Utility-Kotlin). A little work on the [Poker](tags/poker/) recording app, making it easier to share content between Server and Client, then split the UI out into it's own [GitHub Project](https://github.com/AlexHedley/poker-hud) ([Site](https://alexhedley.com/poker-hud/)) to ease working on that. Need to finish at least one and try it out on the [Screen](https://alexhedley.com/poker-recording/screen). Also integrated some of the calculations from the external libs to show there too.

During the back end of the year I got back into recording some 599CD [TechHelp](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=1275) videos ([courses](https://alexhedley.com/courses/)) with the help of some new [Streaming Equipment 3](streaming-equipment-3) including a **Green Screen XL**.

- [VB.NET](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2971)
  - [VB.NET Beginner 0](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=4267)
- [SQL](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=4284)

I'm building up a set of intro videos on how to use _MS SQL Server_ with the goal to show how to use it in _VB.NET_. Just need to lay a lot of the groundwork, so many interlinked things to cover.

I also recorded [VB.NET Beginner 3](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2953) which is due for release soon. Hoping to finish off the rest of the Beginner/Expert and start building my own course outlines.
