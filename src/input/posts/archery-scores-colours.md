<!-- # Archery Scores Colours -->

I've made an update to my [Archery Scores](https://alexhedley.com/archery/) website. I wanted to easily indicate what scores I got and match the colours to the target.

![Scores (Alt) Colours](images/archery/scores_alt_colours.png "Scores (Alt) Colours")

Should I add some opacity?

Let's see if I can get a full block of gold ðŸ¥‡ one day!
