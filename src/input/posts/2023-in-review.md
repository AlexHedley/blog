<!-- # 2023 in review -->

A few years back I used to write up a review of my year, not sure why I stopped but thought it would be a good time to start it up again so here's 2023:

Looking back I've achieved a lot, both professionally and personally.

_Professional Achievements_

I finally took the time to invest in obtaining some certifications. This began in **April** with achieving my [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](aws-certified-cloud-practitioner), alongside that I was running through the hands on [AWS Cloud Quest](aws-cloud-quest) which is my much preferred way of learning! Keeping up to date with the various changes in AWS is key, especially when I might not be working with these resources day to day.

The following month I achieved my [Certified in Cybersecurity‚Ñ† - CC](cc) from [ISC2](https://www.isc2.org/) and have been working on my CPEs for the rest of the year.

In **June** I had the opportunity to travel to the Barbican for the [LeadDev London 2023](leaddev-london-2023) with only a select number of colleagues. This was a fantastic event.

In **October** I completed the [Green Software for Practitioners (LFC131)](lfc131) from [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

Another goal of mine was to work with .NET, this being Blazor. When I built a tool in Blazor Web Assembly (WASM) - [Blazor Interactive](dotnet-blazor-interactive) which gave me the opportunity to give a talk on the subject at my local [meetup](tags/meetup/) - [Blazor Interactive (Talk)](talk-blazorinteractive). This was a fantastic experience to be able to stand up in front of my peers and talk about something I am passionate about. I'd been giving various [talks](tags/talk/) internally at work but these were via an online meeting.

In **October** I contributed to [Hacktoberfest 2023](hacktoberfest-2023). Open Source is key in our industry and I urge anyone to help, no matter how small the piece of work, I tend to do documentation as that's the last thing most people like to do and it's just as important.

Finally, **December** can mean only one thing - [‚≠ê AoC 2023](aoc-2023). I had fun in C# again, got quite a few days done at the start then couldn't really get back into after having a week off. The good thing is I can go back whenever I want and I also got my sticker from the competition at work.

_Personal Achievements_

In **March** I began my official journey learning the [üé∑ Saxophone](saxophone). This is something I've wanted to do since being at school, just never got round to it. It's been quite a challenge. Learning to read music has been rather difficult and at times I've lost motivation but I've kept it going and thoroughly enjoying it. One day, I may share my private YouTube playlist of my progression.

Fitness has been lacking this year, I've not done as many [The Conqueror](tags/the-conqueror) challenges, but I did complete [The Conqueror 2023](the-conqueror-2023) completing over 1700km for the year. I also completed my [1st Parkrun](parkrun-whitleybay-nov2023), many thanks to a dear school friend who drove over and ran it with me, knacked my knee as I hadn't done any running at all this year, but it hasn't put me off doing another, just need to train a bit more first, 5km as my first go probably wasn't the best idea!

Having dabbled with [electronics](tags/electronics/) over the last couple of years I worked more on my [inventr.io](tags/inventr/) **30 Days Lost in Space** and started building my own "Smart" [üÉè Poker](tags/poker/) table, it's still a WIP but has been a lot of fun bringing various disciplines together, especially the fact I got to do some woodwork in my workshop (aka the garage).

I've continued my [üé≥ Bowling](https://alexhedley.com/bowling/) with the local league I joined last year. I've stayed consistent and still having lots of fun with an average score of **119** which isn't bad!

About 18 months after my first beginners course I completed the second in the series: [Blacksmith Tools](blacksmiths-tools). This had me forging many of my own tools ready for my own workshop, one day... This was much more difficult than the first course and I maybe won't leave it as long between the next, more so because I don't have my own forge to practice, so took a while to get back into the swing of things. Very happy with what I produced, and a tough but rewarding 3 days of great work.

<!-- Another thing I've been looking to get back into was recording some video training tutorials. I bought a lot of gear a few years back (see [twitch](twitch)) and seems a shame not to use it. I've had the opportunity to record three courses so far: [git Beginner Level 1](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2970), [Rubberduck VBA Intro](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2972) and [VB.NET Beginner 1](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2951) with the intention of re-recording the original [VB6](https://599cd.com/site/courselist/vb/) courses [Rich](https://599cd.com/richardrost) did way back when then adding more content going forward. Still lots to improve on but practice makes perfect. -->
