I've started making more tutorials and putting them up on here. I was using a crude method of divs and classes to highlight different code which looked ok but I'd seen it looks much better on other sites so I went looking and found [Syntax Highlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) which does an amazing job. I've used it on [My Twitter integration tutorial](http://alexhedley.com/testing/twitter.asp) locally and a quick hosted [demo](http://alexhedley.com/workings/highlighter/index.html). I think it makes the page look a lot better. I'm gonna add it to my 599CD Classroom, hopefully in the next couple of days.
