I love [Instagram](http://instagr.am/) :) I need to take more photos tho, just be more creative.

I've come across two sites since they released their [API](http://instagram.com/developer/) that do some cool things.

The first is [Insta Goodies](http://instagoodies.com/) "Stickers of your Instagram photos!" hence the reason I need to take more photos.

The next is [Instagrid](http://instagrid.me/) - "A Clean Web Gallery For Your Instagram Photos", this is because there isn't an easy way on the web to see all your photos, you can scan through your feed on the iPhone app but it's small etc. Hopefully more things will become available soon or make your own using the API!
