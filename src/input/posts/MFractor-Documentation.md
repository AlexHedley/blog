Whilst in the #mfractor channel of the [xamarinchat](https://xamarinchat.slack.com/) [slack](https://slack.com/) I offered some help to add/update the documentation for MFractor.

The documentation for this product if fab, they use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) which I'm familiar with so that helped the barrier of getting started.

As with any product, documentation is key to helping users find their way about it, and since I use this product and like to help out I offered some assistance.

The page in question was for the **Image Tooltips** feature, which you can find more about on the [blog post](https://www.mfractor.com/blogs/news/mfractor-3-10-smarter-code-fixes-plus-image-and-color-tooltips).

I'm hoping to contribute more in the coming weeks, and look forward to the features being added daily, check out Matthew's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewrdev) to see anything he's working on.
