<!-- # ISC2 North East England Chapter November 2023 Meeting - 10 Year Anniversary -->

This evening I went along to my first in person ISC2 North East England Chapter meetup. It was their 10th Anniversary Event which and a rebrand from (ISC)¬≤ to ISC2 meant new swag, who doesn't want a pin badge, pen and cap?

The usual pizza and drinks were kindly provided by the sponsor, alongside a tonne of sweets and muffins!

It was a packed night with 4 speakers, see the agenda below for more details. An interesting mix covering different topics. Lots to take home and think about.

Lovely to meet some new people and keep the North East scene active.
