<!-- ðŸŽ· Saxophone - Peripherals -->

It's been about a month and I'm really enjoying learning to play. Let's stock up on some peripherals.

Got some 2 and 2.5 reeds to try out. Mouthpiece patches as I'd knicked one of the teachers, a care kit and some earplugs, although I should probably give them to the neighbour. I was also told that [D'Addario](https://www.daddario.com/) have a points scheme so whenever you buy their products, add the code to your account.
