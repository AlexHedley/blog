## Description

This month we have Peter Bull presenting a talk on Universal Windows Platform and Adrian Booth is back again this time to run us through Azure Functions.

## Talk #1 - Universal Windows Platform

Universal Windows Platform allows you create applications for Windows 10, allowing them to support a wide range of devices from the giant screens of Surface Hub to Windows 10 desktops, tablets and devices like Xbox One.

There are many features to take advantage of when building applications, including the new Fluent Design Language that make sure applications look good and work well on all supported devices current or future, such new desktop PC, tablets or event folding tablets. I will demonstrate how you can build a simple Universal Windows Platform example in Visual Studio 2017 using the Windows 10 SDK.

### About Peter Bull

"I started out writing simple BASIC examples for myself, then throughout past years I've programmed with Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Silverlight and most recently Xamarin and Universal Windows Platform. I've written many tutorials for all those platforms to share my knowledge and help others learn. I'm regarded by many as an expert in all things Microsoft, including owning a few Windows phones and Zune music players."

"I've been an ASP.NET web developer for the past few years where I've worked on a variety of applications as diverse as an online second-hand book store, through to online data management portals and internal web-based tools."

## Talk #2 - Azure Functions

Azure functions provide event based on demand processing for your web applications, they don't require any virtual hardware or additional configuration of your cloud infrastructure. Adrian will give an example of why he chose an azure function for a specific task with some details of things you can / can't do. He'll then give a quick walk through of the code and tooling.

### About Adrian Booth

"After spending my youth mashing the keyboard of my commodore trying, sometimes even successfully, to make something interesting happen I went on to study Computer science at university where I discovered a love of AI and data optimisation.

Since then I have spent the last 10 years working as a software developer with a brief hiatus in to study a Masters in Intelligent Systems. I currently work for Bede Gaming as a .NET Developer working on a custom cms for high traffic sites."

## Details

Hainton DotNet Newcastle is a monthly .NET meetup taking place on the last Tuesday of every month at Campus North.

Each meetup will consist of an hours worth of talks from speakers presenting topics relevant to the .NET space.

After all talks have taken place there will be the opportunity to network between yourselves.

Plenty of pizza and drinks will be available throughout the night - thanks to our February sponsor BEDE GAMING.

Tickets sold out last month so we'd advise grabbing a ticket ASAP.

(As always, this is a meetup for .NET professionals only. No sales or recruitment professionals will be allowed entry into Campus North).
