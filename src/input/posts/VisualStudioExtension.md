Visual Studio Extensions are a fantastic way to add extra functionality to the [IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

There is a whole [SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/visual-studio-sdk?view=vs-2019) to play around with.

Then the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) for Windows and [Add-Ins](https://addins.monodevelop.com/) for Mac.

I've gotten a peak with the [Build Light](/post/BuildLight) extension I've help build to see it from both sides.

I've also watched [@BrianLagunas](https://twitter.com/brianlagunas) show off some of the code needed for the [Prism Template Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BrianLagunas.PrismTemplatePack) wizard on his streams:

Watch this space for more info after I've had some time to look into it more.
