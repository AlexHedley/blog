<!-- # 1st Parkrun -->

Today I completed my first Parkrun in Whitley Bay!

Thanks for the encourage and support from Mr Lish! I would never have gotten out and ran it if you hadn't organised coming over to the Bay and persuading me to get my pristine running shoes on.

The sun was shining, there was a rainbow ðŸŒˆ as we started, with what looked like it might be snow, but was just a mild shower.
