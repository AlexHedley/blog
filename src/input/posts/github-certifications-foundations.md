I took this in a Pearson VUE testing center instead of an online proctored exam. Don't need to worry about the internet dropping out etc.

I Took about 30 minutes in total, you do have the option to review answers, which is beneficial, but I didn't want to second guess myself so just submitted.

There was a nice screen at the end, clearly coloured green and let me know I'd passed, with the above breakdown of %.

I've linked a discussion below which I agree with, there seemed to be some quite specific questions that were less foundation and probably better suite to the further exams. Having weights against each section would be good to know what things need more concentration.

I clearly don't know enough around "Privacy, Security, and Administration", this was prob due to the extensive questions on GitHub Enterprise which I've not worked with at all so only had fleeting knowledge from the training material. But who knows, would be interesting to see my actual answers but that'll never happen.
