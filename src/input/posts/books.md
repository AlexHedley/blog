I buy a number of eBooks, especially on [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/), the problem is I can never remember which ones I have, and hardly ever make the time to read them, but you never know when they'll come in handy.

Of course I made a list:

- https://alexhedley.com/books/
  - https://github.com/AlexHedley/books/

I've still got a number of sites to add to it, WIP like most of my other [Projects](https://alexhedley.com/projects/).
