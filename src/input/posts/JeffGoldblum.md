In a previous [post](/post/StreamDeckToolkit/) I discussed the [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) and adding docs to the .NET toolkit.

Whilst watching a stream from [JM](https://www.twitch.tv/jamesmontemagno/) Aden [suggested](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/MyStreamTimer/issues/36) he add a StreamDeck Plugin to [MyStreamTimer](https://www.mystreamtimer.com/)

- Stream Deck Extension for My Stream Timer | C# | @JamesMontemagno
  - https://www.twitch.tv/videos/744833142

TODO: Add YouTube link since Twitch expires.

A couple of weeks later James did a stream for a presentation he was preparing for:

- Preparing a Presentation! #OBS #StreamDeck #PowerPoint | @JamesMontemagno
  - https://www.twitch.tv/videos/758464643

A project [Tree Count](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/streamdeck-treecount/) was created for this.

Roll forward a couple of hours and [Mads](https://twitter.com/mkristensen) is on stream, with James producing: [Writing Visual Studio Extensions with Mads - Controlling the clipboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_nTdXzterM&list=PLReL099Y5nRdG2n1PrY_tbCsUznoYvqkS) and he needed some lorem ipsum text. Of course there's only one place you should get filler text and this is [Jeffsum](https://jeffsum.com/).

This gave me a thought! Why not create an OBS/StreamDeck plugin using [Jeffsum.NET](https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Jeffsum.NET) to grab JG quotes.
