DevHub North is kicking off 2020 with a bang!💥

We're welcoming all Developers, Tech / Digital / Marketing Professionals, Students and anyone else who has an interest in all things DEV, to join us at our January meet up event 💬

Whether your a regular attendee or it's your first DevHub event, expect a brilliant opportunity to network with like-minded tech professionals, share your own experiences and hear from some amazing speakers. After such a successful November meet-up (nearly 100 attendees) - we plan on adding MORE pizza and MORE beers, so make sure you secure your place!

The doors open at 5:00pm which gives you time to grab a drink, settle in and network if you wish, before the first talk at 5:30 🍻
