## Green-screen

I recently bought a Green Screen XL from [Elgato](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/p/green-screen-xl) ([Streaming Equipment 3](streaming-equipment-3)) and now need to setup the scenes.

1. Open up Streamlabs Desktop, go to your camera source, right-click on it and go to filters.

2. From there, you will see chroma key as a filter type. You’re going to see a many different settings that you’re going to have to play around with to find what works for you. There is no one correct answer for these settings as everybody’s lighting situations different, hair is different, skin color is different, and background is different, which is why you’re going to have to play around with it until you refine it down.

## Stream Deck Pedal

How cool is the teamDeck Pedal Action Bar!! It shows you what actions you have configured for each pedal and floats above any app on your screen.

If you close this, click in the _Task Bar_ icon to get the Stream Deck options then _Stream Deck Pedal_ will have a **Show/Hide Action Bar** toggle option.
