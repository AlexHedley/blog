I want a today Widget to show pollen count.

I downloaded:

Clarityn’s Pollen Forecast UK by Bayer HealthCare AG

https://appsto.re/gb/tPFfw.i

They have a website

http://www.claritynallergy.co.uk/allergyforecast/?zip=X

It doesn't have the Widget I wanted so I started looking for an API.

Progress I've started building my own

The Widget needs a lot of work but the basis is there, I've built a framework that gets all the data. Now to finish the UI...
