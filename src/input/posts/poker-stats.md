Whilst working on the tracking of the cards I thought it might be also useful to see certain stats, luckily I don't have to do the calculations myself and have found 2 projects written in C# I can repurpose. The first is **PokerOddsPro** from _@dyh1213_ and the other is **Poker-Hand-Evaluator** from _@danielpaz6_.

I'm forked them to keep a copy and am moving them into the [Poker](https://github.com/AlexHedley/poker-recording/tree/app/src/Poker) source for the main repo.

There is still some work to combine the stats together and I'm looking to deploy them as a Blazor WASM app so you can try them out yourself. I also need to add in the capability to burn cards.

You can try out _@dyh1213_'s here: [https://dyh1213.github.io/PokerOddsPro.io/](https://dyh1213.github.io/PokerOddsPro.io/)
