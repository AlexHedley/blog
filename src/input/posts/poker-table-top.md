<!-- # Poker Table Top -->

I have a Cardinal Poker Table top that folds in 4 and opens to 35".

It's a little shy of that but close enough.

I bought a piece of 6mm MDF cut to 38" square.

Drew corner to corner to get the center, then measured in 1.5" from each edge to draw a square.

Next i measured 8.75" from the center each way, and joined the dots to draw a hexagon.

I placed the folded out table in the center and drew around it.

I'll get to cutting off the corners and sanding at a later date.

I've placed the 4 cameras around the table, in a rough position.

I will need to drill a gap from edge to edge to allow for the charging cable to fit, deciding on length is a job for a later day.

I will also be making a stand (|‾) <!-- Г ◸ --> to hang the top camera from.
