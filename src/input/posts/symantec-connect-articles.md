<!-- # Symantec Connect Articles -->

<!-- In my previous job I was a Symantec Workflow Developer and used to write up anything I found whilst building applications. This used their Community site. -->

I've put all my Symantec Connect Articles into a Blog - [Symantec Connect Articles](https://alexhedley.com/symantec-connect-articles/).

It's using [Statiq.Web](https://www.statiq.dev/web) just like this one.

The content was originally hosted on [Symantec Connect](https://www.symantec.com/connect/) then migrated to the [Broadcom Community](https://community.broadcom.com/) when they acquired Symantec.

In my previous post "[Symantec Connect - 100 Solutions](symantec-connect-100-solutions)" I shared a milestone I made back in 2019. I'm not sure why at the time I didn't keep a copy of this content on my own blog but that has now been fixed.

I built an XML parsing tool ([Broadcom Community Parser](https://github.com/AlexHedley/broadcom-community-parser)) that took the export of my content and converted it to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and also downloaded the accompanying images. This is now hosted at [https://alexhedley.com/symantec-connect-articles/](https://alexhedley.com/symantec-connect-articles/). It still needs a little tidying up, some images are missing which I'm unlikely to find but the majority is looking good.

I might also grab a copy of my colleagues posts for historic purposes too.

Another great resource is Andrew's site: [atmaworkflow](https://atmaworkflow.wordpress.com/).
