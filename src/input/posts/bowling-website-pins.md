<!-- # Bowling Scores - Pins -->

My very good friend [@mpbostock](https://github.com/mpbostock) looked at my horrible code and didn't think that the pins should be in a table, so kindly fixed it for me!

I think it took longer for him to add his gpg key to sign his commits than it did to fix my horrible horrible code!

> make pins look sexy

I think he did!
