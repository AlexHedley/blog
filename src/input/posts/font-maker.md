So I've got a load of images for a font from a game.

Is there an easy way to make a font from them?

How said use Gimp, which needed Inkscape which needed X11 etc

Couldn't get this to work.

Instead I created it using:

Had to manually draw them but it worked, maybe on the small side so might have to increase.

Didn't seem to have theÂ symbols in the Preview tho.
