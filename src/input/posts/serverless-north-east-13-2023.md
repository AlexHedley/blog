<!-- # Serverless North East Meetup 13 2023 -->

Finally got along to a Serverless North East Meetup and what a great one to be at.

Lee explained 8 great Design Patterns, see the blog post and video for more information.

We then got a sneak peak at EventNet: a tool for testing EventBridge events, looking forward to when that's released.

Got some awesome AWS swag too, so thanks for that.

## Agenda

This evening we will be welcoming AWS Community Builder and Global Enterprise Serverless Architect Lee Gilmore.

He's going to tell us about "Unlocking Serverless Superpowers: Mastering the 8 Crucial Design Patterns Every Engineer Should Know". If you've read some of his blogs you'll know you're in for a great session.

We also have Specialist Technical Design Lead Steve Morland with "Testing Event-Driven Architectures" touching a bit on CDK, Ephemeral Environments, Jest and Schema Validation. Fresh from his hands on session during TechNExt this should be an informative session and is something that people new to Serverless usually struggle with.

Looking forward to these.

Also a big thank you to Steve and Leighton for hosting us and providing the customary pizza and beverages.
