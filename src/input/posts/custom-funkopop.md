<!-- # Custom Funko Pop -->

You may not already know but I have an obsession with collecting things, one of which is [Funko](https://funko.com/) Pops, as you can see from my [website](https://alexhedley.com/funkopop/). I'm hoping to complete my LotR collection, but there's a few rare ones left to get.

Whilst on X (Twitter) I saw a post showing people making themselves using [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) using the following prompt:

- https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator?p=Funko+figure+of+a+%5Bmale%5D%2C+smiling%2C+called%5B+STEPHEN+REID%5D%2C+wearing+a+%5Bblack+henley+t-shirt%5D%2C+a+%5Bcanary+yellow+hoodie%5D%2C+a+%5Bblack+leather+jacket%5D%2C+%5Bblack+ripped+jeans%5D+and+%5Bwhite+adidas+trainers+with+black+stripes%5D%2C+%5Bshaved+head%5D+and+%5Bshaved+beard%5D.+The+Funko+is+displayed+inside+and+outside+a+limited+edition+%5Bgreen+and+yellow%5D+Funko+box+with+%5BDIGITAL+DRUID%5D+text%2C+allowing+visibility+of+the+figure%2C+typography%2C+3D+render.+%5BWhite%5D+background

I ameneded this a little to

> Funko figure of a male, smiling, called Alex Hedley, wearing a oxford shirt, blue jeans and chelsea boots with a red sole, short brown hair and slight ginger beard, with glasses. The Funko is displayed inside and outside a limited edition red and black Funko box with Wizard text sticker and a single number 8, allowing visibility of the figure, typography, 3D render. white background

and after a few re-generates I came to the following:

![Custom Funko Pop](images/custom-funkopop.jpeg "Custom Funko Pop")

Even with a jazzy shirt!

I now need to find someone to actually make it.

How about you try your own?!
