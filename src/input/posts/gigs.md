I kept a list of the gigs I've been to over the years. Originally it was hosted elsewhere but I've moved it over to GitHub.

I later added a gig ticket example, tried to make it look like the paper ones you used to get, it's now an optional add-on called a "souvenir ticket" and costs about a fiver! But it does look good in the gig scrapbook.
