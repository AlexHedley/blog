<!-- GitHub Actions -->

Another community talk at work, this time for the Software Delivery Community. We are starting a series to run through a few of the providers like GitHub and GitLab. I did a very beginner one, looking to expand in the future and hopefully show one of the GitHub Actions I've built.

🗓️ November 5, 2023
