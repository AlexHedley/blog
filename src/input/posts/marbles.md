## About

**Marble making class suitable for beginners**

In this one day class, you will make a number of marbles starting off with clear and moving on through the day to produce marbles with coloured patternation on the outside, mixed coloured twists on the inside and trapping bubbles inside the glass. By the end of the class, you will have made your very own hand made marbles.

Marbles you make have to be annealed overnight, so you will have to come back to pick up your work, If you are unable to pick up your work please inform when booking and we can arrange postage of your items at cost.

Lunch Break 12.30-1.30 bring your own lunch or its advised to pre-order your lunch in the restaurant.
