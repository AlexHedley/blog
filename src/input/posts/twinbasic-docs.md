<!-- ![twinBASIC](images/twinBASIC.jpeg "twinBASIC") -->

I've been following the [twinBASIC](https://twinbasic.com/) journey for a number of years and as it's nearing v1 so I thought I'd give it another go.
I think the last time I used it, it was a [VSCode Ext](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twinbasic.twinbasic), but now it is an EXE. One push for this was the [twinBASIC Monthly Challenge #1](https://docs.twinbasic.com/Challenges/1) **Self-Contained Diagnostic Tool**. I downloaded the latest [Release](https://github.com/twinbasic/twinbasic/releases) from GitHub and started trying it out.

I was already a member of the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/UaW9GgKKuE) but if you aren't already, please join.

I had a couple of questions on how the IDE worked and since these weren't answered by the [docs](https://docs.twinbasic.com/), at the moment, I thought I can't be the only one who might ask so why don't I contribute to them to help others!

Alongside this I added/updated some of the [Just The Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) config [#30](https://github.com/twinbasic/documentation/pull/30) to make it easier for others to contribute.

I added the [twinBASIC Monthly Challenge #1](https://docs.twinbasic.com/Challenges/1) for better visibility and a historic item if people arrive to it late and still want a go. The subsequent ones can be added each month.

There are some legacy videos [#34](https://github.com/twinbasic/documentation/pull/34) on [@twinBASIC](https://www.youtube.com/twinBASIC) YouTube channel which would be useful to accompany the docs too.

The [IDE](https://docs.twinbasic.com/tB/IDE) _Tour_ [#25](https://github.com/twinbasic/documentation/pull/25) and _Controls_ [#23](https://github.com/twinbasic/documentation/pull/23) sections will probably take a while to produce but I might just get the boiler plate pages built so others can contribute too. Also if there is a way to autogenerate all the Properties/Methods etc like [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) does that would save some work.
