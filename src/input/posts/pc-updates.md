<!-- # PC Updates -->

Having a friend build a PC for me a number of years ago I've tweaked a few parts myself since the initial setup.

I've been looking to do more [3D Printing](3dprinter) and there are two ways I can send the models to the machine. One is via a cable connected to the printer directly, or the other is through an SD card.

I found an old external SD reader but was having issues getting it to work so I've bought an internal reader instead.

This was a really easy install, just pop the front of the remaining slot and then plug the device into a spare port.

The major oversight I had was this is much smaller than the fitting.

Back to the shops to by an adapter:

Hopefully this fits as expected, we shall see when it arrives.
