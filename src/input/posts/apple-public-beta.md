Signed up for the Public beta, shouldn't it be this easy for devs or am I just being lazy?

You install a certificate, which then requires a restart, really! [![](images/img_1882.png)](https://alexhedley.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_1882.png)Â  You're advised to make a backup.

Archive an iOS backup with iTunes

It installs a nice Feedback app:
