<!-- # Blashing - Blazing Story -->

Having found [Blazing Story](blazingstory) I had to try it out with some of my own Blazor Components. I thought why not use [Blashing](the-beginning-of-blashing).

I followed the thorough steps in their readme and got to creating the required `stories.razor` files. Added the required arguments and ran the app:

![Example](images/blashing/blashing-blazorstory.png "Example")

There's a few errors thrown when clicking on the different examples which I need to look into but it's just the beginning.

Such a well made project :).
