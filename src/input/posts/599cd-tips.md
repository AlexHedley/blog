I've added a new section for VB.NET on the [Tips](http://599cd.alexhedley.com/tips/) section of 599CD on my site.

I was recently creating a few small apps for work and decided to do them in VB.NET instead of VB6.
I still like VB6, it can seem simplier to use if you just wanna create something small.

I also decided to do it in VS as some colleagues use C# and we could test similar methods.
It was only a simple look up to an Access db, fill in a datagrid and display some information.
I also wanted to convert some Access dbs to have VB.NET fronts so I started working with Graphs and seeing if I could replicate it here too.

Not sure how much more I'll be working with it going forward as I have other projects but thought I'd jot down what I've done so far so I can go back and use this as reference.
