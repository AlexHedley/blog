Reading Chapter 7 - KVC/KVO of Cocoa Programming

https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/cocoa-programming/

And learning about Array Operators like

- avg
- count
- max
- min
- sum

These could come in handy.

```objectivec
NSNumber *theAverages
theAverage = [employees valueForKey:@"avg.expectedRaise"];
```
