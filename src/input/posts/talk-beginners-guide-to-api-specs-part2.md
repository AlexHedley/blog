<!-- Beginners Guide to API Specs - Part 2 -->

In [Part 1](talk-beginners-guide-to-api-specs) I ran through what an API Specification is, showed the underlying JSON (or YAML) and how it looked as a Swagger website.
In this presentation I showed you how to interrogate and visualise your data with a tool called [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), how to annotate your code  with a Kotlin example ([LEGO API Demo](https://github.com/alex-hedley/demo-lego-api)) and discussed the Editor and Generator for helping with the API.
