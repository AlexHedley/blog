Welcome to my new Blog!

I'd originally started blogging back in [2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20131211111731/http://alexhedley.com/blog/), built with Classic ASP, yes I'm that cool!, I wasn't that disciplined and the posts were more to note down interesting things I worked on or found in my day to day life.

When I began iOS development I moved to [WP](https://alexhedley.wordpress.com/) and wrote up a number of detailed posts on my journey, this was useful to track progress and share anything I found along the way.

An opportunity at worked allowed me to build both a native iOS and Android app which I wrote about at every opportunity.

In recent years I've not found the time, balancing dev work above writing up process, this I want to change so thought it was time for a new platform and since I enjoying using GitHub it was time to blog here instead.

In the coming weeks you'll hopefully be seeing a more frequent posting schedule I had a few years back.
