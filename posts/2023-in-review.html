        <!-- # 2023 in review -->
<p>A few years back I used to write up a review of my year, not sure why I stopped but thought it would be a good time to start it up again so here's 2023:</p>
<p>Looking back I've achieved a lot, both professionally and personally.</p>
<p><em>Professional Achievements</em></p>
<p>I finally took the time to invest in obtaining some certifications. This began in <strong>April</strong> with achieving my <a href="aws-certified-cloud-practitioner">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>, alongside that I was running through the hands on <a href="aws-cloud-quest">AWS Cloud Quest</a> which is my much preferred way of learning! Keeping up to date with the various changes in AWS is key, especially when I might not be working with these resources day to day.</p>
<p>The following month I achieved my <a href="cc">Certified in Cybersecurity℠ - CC</a> from <a href="https://www.isc2.org/">ISC2</a> and have been working on my CPEs for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>In <strong>June</strong> I had the opportunity to travel to the Barbican for the <a href="leaddev-london-2023">LeadDev London 2023</a> with only a select number of colleagues. This was a fantastic event.</p>
<p>In <strong>October</strong> I completed the <a href="lfc131">Green Software for Practitioners (LFC131)</a> from <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">The Linux Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Another goal of mine was to work with .NET, this being Blazor. When I built a tool in Blazor Web Assembly (WASM) - <a href="dotnet-blazor-interactive">Blazor Interactive</a> which gave me the opportunity to give a talk on the subject at my local <a href="tags/meetup">meetup</a> - <a href="talk-blazorinteractive">Blazor Interactive (Talk)</a>. This was a fantastic experience to be able to stand up in front of my peers and talk about something I am passionate about. I'd been giving various <a href="tags/talk">talks</a> internally at work but these were via an online meeting.</p>
<p>In <strong>October</strong> I contributed to <a href="hacktoberfest-2023">Hacktoberfest 2023</a>. Open Source is key in our industry and I urge anyone to help, no matter how small the piece of work, I tend to do documentation as that's the last thing most people like to do and it's just as important.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>December</strong> can mean only one thing - <a href="aoc-2023">⭐ AoC 2023</a>. I had fun in C# again, got quite a few days done at the start then couldn't really get back into after having a week off. The good thing is I can go back whenever I want and I also got my sticker from the competition at work.</p>
<p><em>Personal Achievements</em></p>
<p>In <strong>March</strong> I began my official journey learning the <a href="saxophone">🎷 Saxophone</a>. This is something I've wanted to do since being at school, just never got round to it. It's been quite a challenge. Learning to read music has been rather difficult and at times I've lost motivation but I've kept it going and thoroughly enjoying it. One day, I may share my private YouTube playlist of my progression.</p>
<p>Fitness has been lacking this year, I've not done as many <a href="tags/the-conqueror">The Conqueror</a> challenges, but I did complete <a href="the-conqueror-2023">The Conqueror 2023</a> completing over 1700km for the year. I also completed my <a href="parkrun-whitleybay-nov2023">1st Parkrun</a>, many thanks to a dear school friend who drove over and ran it with me, knacked my knee as I hadn't done any running at all this year, but it hasn't put me off doing another, just need to train a bit more first, 5km as my first go probably wasn't the best idea!</p>
<p>Having dabbled with <a href="tags/electronics">electronics</a> over the last couple of years I worked more on my <a href="tags/inventr">inventr.io</a> <strong>30 Days Lost in Space</strong> and started building my own &quot;Smart&quot; <a href="tags/poker">🃏 Poker</a> table, it's still a WIP but has been a lot of fun bringing various disciplines together, especially the fact I got to do some woodwork in my workshop (aka the garage).</p>
<p>I've continued my <a href="https://alexhedley.com/bowling/">🎳 Bowling</a> with the local league I joined last year. I've stayed consistent and still having lots of fun with an average score of <strong>119</strong> which isn't bad!</p>
<p>About 18 months after my first beginners course I completed the second in the series: <a href="blacksmiths-tools">Blacksmith Tools</a>. This had me forging many of my own tools ready for my own workshop, one day... This was much more difficult than the first course and I maybe won't leave it as long between the next, more so because I don't have my own forge to practice, so took a while to get back into the swing of things. Very happy with what I produced, and a tough but rewarding 3 days of great work.</p>
<!-- Another thing I've been looking to get back into was recording some video training tutorials. I bought a lot of gear a few years back (see [twitch](twitch)) and seems a shame not to use it. I've had the opportunity to record three courses so far: [git Beginner Level 1](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2970), [Rubberduck VBA Intro](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2972) and [VB.NET Beginner 1](https://599cd.com/blog/display-article.asp?ID=2951) with the intention of re-recording the original [VB6](https://599cd.com/site/courselist/vb/) courses [Rich](https://599cd.com/richardrost) did way back when then adding more content going forward. Still lots to improve on but practice makes perfect. -->
